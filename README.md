![Sorting Visualizer Demo](demo.gif)

## Description

This project is a sorting algorithm visualizer built using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. It provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms, helping users understand how different sorting techniques work.

## Features

- Interactive visualization of popular sorting algorithms.
- Choose from algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
- Adjustable array size and sorting speed for customization.
- Real-time visualization updates as the algorithms progress.

## Demo
